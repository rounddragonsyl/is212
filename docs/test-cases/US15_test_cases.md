# US15 Register for a Confirmed Event (SCRUM-22): test cases

Status: **implemented; all 67 cases pass.** The table was approved on 7 October and the tests
were committed failing (commit `a44c16d`) before any implementation: 65 of 67 failed for the
expected reasons, and AC-015.1.5 and .3.5 already passed because they guard protections that
exist today. One test was then corrected with approval (AC-015.5.4, see "Changes after
approval"). On the final run all 34 SQL cases (44 checks) and 33 app tests pass; the full
suites total 826 app tests and 462 database checks. Implementation: migration
`0043_event_registrations.sql` (commit `881f73c`) and `frontend/src/features/registrations/`.
Live checks on shared Supabase need 0042 and 0043 applied first.

Test IDs follow `CLAUDE.md`: `AC-015.Y.Z`, where Y is the acceptance criterion in Jira order
and Z numbers the tests within it. Z is unique across the story and increases top to bottom
within each test file.

## Design the tests assume (7 October)

| # | Design | Source |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | "Registration enabled" is the existing `events.registration_required` (0001). The organiser sets it in the request form; US52 will give coordinators an on/off screen. No new flag. | Existing schema |
| D2 | **Open for registration** = status `confirmed`, `registration_required = true`, and `proposed_start` still in the future. Enforced in the database by the registration function, not only hidden in the UI. | AC-015.4, AC-015.6; Q4 |
| D3 | New migration `0043_event_registrations.sql`: an `event_registrations` table (event, attendee, status, answers, times). Status is `registered` now; `withdrawn` is allowed by the constraint so US23 can add withdrawal without a schema change. | Brief; US23 |
| D4 | A **unique index on (event, attendee) where status = 'registered'** enforces AC-015.5. A withdrawn registration does not block registering again (Q3). | AC-015.5 |
| D5 | Registering only through one database function, `register_for_event`. It checks the caller is an Attendee, the event is open (D2) and the answers are present, then inserts. Browsers have no insert, update or delete rights on the table. | Brief, key rules |
| D6 | Attendees never read `events`, `venues` or `venue_bookings` directly. Three read-only functions return public fields only: `list_open_events`, `get_open_event` and `list_my_registrations`. | Brief, key rules; Q7 |
| D7 | Public event fields: name, event type, description, programme, start and end, registration prerequisites, and venue name and location from **confirmed** venue bookings (or none). Hidden: purpose, expected attendance, reference, organiser, layout, equipment, accessibility and special arrangements requests, bookings, audit records. | Q7 |
| D8 | A new optional `events.registration_prerequisites` text field holds the prerequisites shown in AC-015.1. No screen edits it yet; it is set by an administrator until US52's coordinator screen. | Q2 |
| D9 | The registration form asks for a **phone number (required)**, **dietary requirements (optional)**, **accessibility needs (optional)**, and an **"I meet the prerequisites" confirmation, required only when the event has prerequisites**. Name and email come from the account. | Q1 |
| D10 | The confirmation email is queued in `notification_outbox` by an AFTER INSERT trigger on `event_registrations`, in the same transaction, and sent by the existing `send-review-notifications` Edge Function. If queueing fails, the registration rolls back. No US4 code changes. | AC-015.3; Q8 |
| D11 | Attendees see the event's current status as Confirmed, Completed or Cancelled: the only statuses a registered event can reach (0004 transitions). Registration status shows as Registered (Withdrawn after US23). | Q5 |
| D12 | US29's `/events/open` placeholder becomes the AC-015.6 list (no second list). Details at `/events/open/:id`; "My registrations" at `/registrations`. All dates in Singapore time through `formatDateTime`. | Brief |

## Assumptions (to confirm with the team or customer)

| # | Assumption | Tests affected |
|---|---|---|
| A1 | Phone numbers are 8 to 15 digits after removing spaces, hyphens and one leading `+`. No country-specific rule. | .2.2–.2.5, .2.14 |
| A2 | Events that have already started are not open for registration, even if still Confirmed. | .4.3, .6.1 |
| A3 | Only Attendees register. Organisers, coordinators, managers, venue and technical staff are refused, including an organiser for their own event. | .2.18–.2.19 |
| A4 | Venue is shown only from confirmed venue bookings; held or pending ones show as "Venue to be confirmed". Several confirmed venues are listed together. | .1.3, .1.9 |
| A5 | Any signed-in user may call the open-events list and details (public information), but only Attendees can register. Visitors who are not signed in get nothing. | .6.5 |
| A6 | There is no screen to edit `registration_prerequisites` yet (D8). | .1.1, .1.9 |
| A7 | The email is plain text, like the other queued emails: event name, start in Singapore time, venue, and a pointer to My registrations. Real delivery is checked manually, as for US4/US7/US14. | .3.1, .3.6 |

## Fixtures (database tests, disposable Docker database only)

| Fixture | Definition |
|---|---|
| Users | `A1`, `A2` attendees; `O1` organiser (role set explicitly, US29); `C1` coordinator; `M1` operations manager; `V1` venue staff; `T1` tech support |
| `E-OPEN` | Confirmed, registration enabled, starts in 2035, prerequisites "Bring a laptop", confirmed booking at `HALL` (name "Main Hall", location "Level 1") |
| `E-OPEN2` | Confirmed, registration enabled, starts earlier in 2035 than `E-OPEN`, no prerequisites, only a held booking |
| `E-CLOSED` | Confirmed, registration **disabled** |
| `E-STATUS` | One event per other status (draft, submitted, under_review, approved, planning, completed, cancelled, rejected), registration enabled |
| `E-PAST` | Confirmed, registration enabled, started one minute ago |

App tests (Vitest) mock Supabase, as the existing tests do.

## Planned test files

| Layer | File |
|---|---|
| SQL | `backend/supabase/tests/event_registrations.sql` (Docker runner; the concurrency case uses `dblink`, as US14 does) |
| Vitest | `frontend/src/features/registrations/__tests__/validation.test.ts`, `registrationService.test.ts`, `RegistrationForm.test.tsx`, `OpenEventDetailsPage.test.tsx`, `MyRegistrationsPage.test.tsx`; `frontend/src/features/events/__tests__/OpenEventsPage.test.tsx` (US29, extended); `frontend/src/components/layout/__tests__/TopNav.test.tsx` |

## Changes after approval

- **AC-015.5.4 (8 October, approved):** the test ran the two-session race and counted the
  registrations in one SQL statement. A statement cannot see writes made by functions it calls,
  so the count always read 0 and the test failed even though the race behaved correctly (second
  session blocked, then refused as a duplicate; one row). The race now runs as its own statement
  and the count follows it, the same lesson recorded for US14. What the test checks is unchanged.

## Regression and changes to existing tests (approved 7 October)

- **All existing app tests and database checks must still pass** (793 app tests, 418 database
  checks before US15).
- **One US29 test changes.** `OpenEventsPage.test.tsx` AC-029.4.6 expects the placeholder text
  "will appear here". Once `/events/open` lists real events, the test must mock the new service
  and expect the list's empty-state message ("No events are open for registration right now.").
  Its intent is unchanged: a signed-in Attendee lands on the events-open-for-registration page.
  AC-029.4.7 and .4.8 (redirect and loading) are unaffected.
