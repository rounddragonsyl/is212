# ConnectSphere Event Planning System — Project Context

## What this is
University project (SMU IS212). Event planning and venue booking for an events company.
Roles: Event Organiser, Event Coordinator, Venue Staff, Technical Support Staff, Attendee.

## Stack
React 18 + TypeScript + Vite · Tailwind · React Hook Form + Zod
Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + RLS) · Vitest + React Testing Library · GitHub Actions

## Architecture rules — follow these without being asked
- Feature folders: src/features/<feature>/ with types.ts, validation.ts, <x>Service.ts,
  components/, __tests__/
- validation.ts holds PURE functions only. No React, no Supabase, no I/O.
- Only <x>Service.ts talks to Supabase. Components never import the Supabase client.
- Business rules are validated in the client (UX) AND constrained in the database
  (integrity). This is deliberate defence in depth.
- Time intervals are half-open [start, end). Touching intervals do not overlap.
- Never use NOT NULL on a field a draft may legitimately omit; use a conditional CHECK
  keyed on status instead.

## Testing
- Name every test after the acceptance criterion it covers:
  test('AC-005.2: rejects submission when purpose is blank', ...)
- Every story needs at least one boundary, conflict or failure test.
- We must reach high coverage and be able to trace acceptance criteria to tests.

## Roles and authorisation
- Roles live in public.profiles.role, never in auth.users. Values: organiser, coordinator,
  venue_staff, tech_support, attendee.
- Read the caller's role in SQL with public.current_user_role(). It is SECURITY DEFINER on
  purpose: a policy on profiles that queries profiles recurses infinitely.
- Roles are assigned by an administrator, never chosen by the user. A trigger blocks a
  signed-in user from changing their own role.
- Hiding UI from a role is a courtesy. The RLS policy is the control. Every role-gated
  screen must have a matching policy, or it is not actually protected.
- dev_set_my_role() and the DevAuthPanel / DevRoleSwitcher components are scaffolding.
  Drop them before release.

## Event status values
draft, submitted, under_review, approved, planning, confirmed, completed, cancelled,
rejected. Review transitions belong in eventReviewService. Explicit draft submission
belongs in eventService so validated details and status change atomically on the same
owned Draft row. Both paths use expected-status filters and database transition triggers.
Draft saves in eventDraftService must never change an existing request's status.

## House style
- No `any`. Prefer explicit types.
- Comment *why*, not *what*. We are examined orally on our design decisions.
- Small components. Extract when a file passes ~150 lines.

## Out of scope for the first release
Reporting, analytics, recurring events, multi-session events, dashboards.
